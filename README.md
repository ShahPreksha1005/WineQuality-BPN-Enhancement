# WineQuality-BPN-Enhancement

### Lab Report: Implementing Learning Factors in Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPN)
This project implements a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPN) model to assess wine quality based on various chemical properties. By integrating learning factors, the network aims to improve convergence speed and model training efficiency.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Dataset**: White wine quality dataset with features like acidity, residual sugar, pH, and alcohol.
- **Goal**: Predict wine quality using a neural network trained with enhanced backpropagation.
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, BPN with learning factors, model evaluation with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed formatting issues for compatibility.
2. **Exploration**: Analyzed distributions and correlations among key features.
3. **Standardization**: Scaled features to optimize neural network performance.

## Model Architecture
